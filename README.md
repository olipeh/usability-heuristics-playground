# Usability Heuristics Playground

A simple website designed as a testing playground for learning Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics. This project intentionally includes usability issues that violate each of the 10 heuristics, providing a hands-on learning experience for testers and UX enthusiasts.

## Purpose

This website serves as an educational tool for mentees and students learning about usability testing. By identifying and analyzing the intentional usability problems in this site, users can develop a better understanding of Nielsen's heuristics and how they impact user experience.

## How to Use

1. Simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser
2. Navigate through the different sections of the website
3. Try to identify which usability heuristic is being violated in each section
4. Use this as a practice ground for usability testing and evaluation

## The 10 Usability Heuristics

This playground demonstrates issues with all ten of Nielsen's usability heuristics:

### 1. Visibility of System Status

**Principle**: The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time.

**Example Issue**: The form submission in the home section provides no feedback or loading indicator when submitted.

### 2. Match Between System and Real World

**Principle**: The system should speak the users' language, with words, phrases, and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms.

**Example Issue**: The Technical Jargon section uses complex technical terminology instead of plain language.

### 3. User Control and Freedom

**Principle**: Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted state.

**Example Issue**: The modal dialog has no close button or escape mechanism.

### 4. Consistency and Standards

**Principle**: Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing.

**Example Issue**: The navigation links and buttons throughout the site use inconsistent styling and terminology for the same actions.

### 5. Error Prevention

**Principle**: Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place.

**Example Issue**: The "Delete Account" button performs the action immediately without any confirmation step.

### 6. Recognition Rather Than Recall

**Principle**: Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible.

**Example Issue**: The About section requires users to remember and enter specific codes instead of selecting from visible options.

### 7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use

**Principle**: Accelerators — unseen by the novice user — may often speed up the interaction for the expert user.

**Example Issue**: The image gallery lacks keyboard shortcuts or efficient navigation methods for power users.

### 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

**Principle**: Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed.

**Example Issue**: The Contact section is cluttered with excessive information, animations, and distractions.

### 9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors

**Principle**: Error messages should be expressed in plain language, precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.

**Example Issue**: The Product Search provides an unhelpful error message that doesn't explain what went wrong or how to fix it.

### 10. Help and Documentation

**Principle**: Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation.

**Example Issue**: The Services section lacks any help documentation or guidance for using the services.
